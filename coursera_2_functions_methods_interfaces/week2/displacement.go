/*
Let us assume the following formula for displacement s as a function of time t, acceleration a, initial velocity v0, and initial displacement s0.
s = 0.5 * a * t^2 + v0 * t + s0

Write a program which first prompts the user to enter values for acceleration, initial velocity, and initial displacement. Then the program should prompt the user to 
enter a value for time and the program should compute the displacement after the entered time.

You will need to define and use a function called GenDisplaceFn() which takes three float64 arguments, acceleration a, initial velocity v0, and initial displacement s0. 
GenDisplaceFn() should return a function which computes displacement as a function of time, assuming the given values acceleration, initial velocity, and initial 
displacement. The function returned by GenDisplaceFn() should take one float64 argument t, representing time, and return one float64 argument which is the displacement 
travelled after time t.

For example, letâ€™s say that I want to assume the following values for acceleration, initial velocity, and initial displacement: a = 10, v0 = 2, s0 = 1. I can use the 
following statement to call GenDisplaceFn() to generate a function fn which will compute displacement as a function of time.
fn := GenDisplaceFn(10, 2, 1)

Then I can use the following statement to print the displacement after 3 seconds.
fmt.Println(fn(3))

And I can use the following statement to print the displacement after 5 seconds.
fmt.Println(fn(5))
*/

func GenDisplaceFn(a, v0, s0 float64) func(t float64) float64 {
	fn := func(t float64) float64 {
		return 0.5*a*math.Pow(t, 2) + v0*t + s0
	}
	return fn
}

func main() {
	var a float64
	var v0 float64
	var s0 float64

	fmt.Println("Enter value for acceleration")
	fmt.Scan(&a)
	fmt.Println("Enter value for initial velocity")
	fmt.Scan(&v0)
	fmt.Println("Enter value for initial displacement")
	fmt.Scan(&s0)

	fn := GenDisplaceFn(a, v0, s0)

	fmt.Println(fn(3))
	fmt.Println(fn(5))
